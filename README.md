# e18e/action-dependency-diff

> A GitHub action for reporting differences in dependencies between two branches or commits.

## What it does

This action compares dependencies between your base branch and current branch, analyzing potential security and maintenance concerns:

- 🔒 **Package trust levels** - Detects decreases in package trust levels (provenance and trusted publisher status)
- 📈 **Dependency growth** - Warns when dependency count increases significantly
- 📦 **Install size** - Warns when package size increases significantly
- 🔄 **Duplicate versions** - Detects packages with multiple versions installed
- ⚠️ **Module replacements** - Identifies new packages that have community-recommended alternatives

## Usage

```yaml
name: Dependency Diff

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  diff_dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read

## Example with custom inputs

```yaml
- name: Create Diff
  uses: e18e/action-dependency-diff@v1
  with:
    base-ref: 'develop'
    dependency-threshold: '5'
    size-threshold: '50000'
```

## Example Workflows

See the [`recipes/`](./recipes/) directory for complete workflow examples:

- [`basic.yml`](./recipes/basic.yml) - Basic dependency diff on pull requests
- [`bundle-diff.yml`](./recipes/bundle-diff.yml) - Advanced workflow with package bundle size analysis

## Always Report Install Size

If you'd like to always report install size, whether it reduces or increases, you can set the `size-threshold` input to `-1`.

```yaml
- name: Create Diff
  uses: e18e/action-dependency-diff@v1
  with:
    size-threshold: -1
```

## Package Bundle Analysis

In addition to analyzing dependency changes, this action can optionally compare the actual bundle sizes of your packages by examining `npm pack` outputs. This provides insights into the **bundle size** (what gets published) rather than just the **install size** (what gets installed with dependencies).

### Package Inputs

The action accepts glob patterns to locate package tarballs for comparison:

- **`base-packages`** - Glob pattern for base branch pack files (e.g., `"./base-packs/*.tgz"`)
- **`source-packages`** - Glob pattern for source branch pack files (e.g., `"./source-packs/*.tgz"`)
- **`pack-size-threshold`** - Threshold in bytes for warning about significant pack size increases

> [!NOTE]
> Package bundle analysis only runs when both `base-packages` and `source-packages` are provided. If these inputs are not set, this feature is skipped entirely.

You can see an example of how to set this up in the [bundle difference workflow](./recipes/bundle-diff.yml).

## Module Replacements

This action automatically scans for new dependencies that have community-recommended replacements or alternatives.

The recommendations come from the [e18e community](https://e18e.dev) and include manifests for:

- Native alternatives
- Micro-utility alternatives
- Generally preferred packages

> [!NOTE]
> Module replacement suggestions are advisory and may not always be straightforward migrations. Review each recommendation carefully and use exclusion features if needed.

## Supported package managers

- npm (package-lock.json)
- Yarn (yarn.lock)
- pnpm (pnpm-lock.yaml)
- bun (bun.lock)

## Permissions

The action requires the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write # To comment on pull requests
```

## Trust levels of packages

The following levels are considered when evaluating package trust:

- **Trusted Publisher (with provenance)** (highest)
- **Provenance**
- **None**

When a package's trust level decreases (e.g., from Trusted Publisher to Provenance), it is flagged in the report.

### `provenance-action` GitHub Action

If you want more information on _why_ the trust level changed, or want to detect changes to the provenance information, we highly recommend using the [provenance-action](https://github.com/danielroe/provenance-action) in addition to this.

The provenance action will tell you exactly what changed in the provenance information. For example, if the repository changed between two versions.
